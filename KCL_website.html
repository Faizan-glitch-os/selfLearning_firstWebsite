    <p>Kanjar Cricket League was founded by Faizan Ahmad and Farooq Hameed in the year 2023. This was happened due to
        <br>
        complications with the Rahman Brothers namely Ibrahim Rahman and Ali Shayan, leading to the departure from
        <br>
        Pecharh Cricket League.Farooq Hameed suggested the name Kanjar Cricket League as He stated that we are all
        <br>
        Kanjars playing in it. This name was warm heartedly accepted by every member. Aizaz Ahmad gently sponsored
        <br>
        the league and gave them personal space so they can peacefully conduct their league. Their younger brothers
        <br>
        Zalan Ahmad, Shehbaz Ahmad and Anas Hameed also played a great role in conducting every event.
        <strong>UbaidUllah</strong>
        <br>
        cousin to every member of Kanjar Cricket League also plays vital role in conducting the event. Other people who
        <br>
        helps sometimes are Ibrahim, Mustafa, Ibrar Ahmad and Bilal Ahmad.
