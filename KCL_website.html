    <p>Kanjar Cricket League was founded by Faizan Ahmad and Farooq Hameed in the year 2023. This was happened due to
        complications with
        the Rahman Brothers namely Ibrahim Rahman and Ali Shayan, leading to the departure from Pecharh Cricket
        League.Farooq Hameed
        suggested the name Kanjar Cricket League as He stated that we are all Kanjars playing in it. This name was warm
        heartedly accepted
        by every member. Aizaz Ahmad gently sponsored the league and
        gave them personal
        space so they can peacefully conduct their league. Their younger brothers Zalan Ahmad, Shehbaz Ahmad and Anas
        Hameed also played
        a great role in conducting every event. <strong>UbaidUllah</strong> cousin to every member of Kanjar Cricket
        League also plays
        vital role in conducting the event. Other people who helps sometimes are Ibrahim, Mustafa, Ibrar Ahmad and Bilal
        Ahmad.
